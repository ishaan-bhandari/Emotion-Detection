# Emotion_Detection
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to help perform Sentiment Analysis

Dropout reasons like unadaptable teaching styles and content difficulty are cited. Emotion detection, based on student feedback, can identify feelings of confusion, frustration, or delight during sessions. This data enables instructors to personalize their teaching and improve student engagement. Emotion detection has broader applications in smart cars, video game testing, and user feedback. The technology relies on face detection, which plays a crucial role in accurately analyzing emotions from facial expressions. Dlib, a popular Python library, is used for face detection in this project. Implementing emotion detection can lead to enhanced learning experiences and more reliable feedback in various domains.
